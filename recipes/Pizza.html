      <li><b>Dough:</b> 1 pound store-bought pizza dough (or homemade)</li>
      <li><b>Sauce:</b> 1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Prepare the Dough and Preheat:</b> Preheat your oven to 450°F
        (232°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
        Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out your pizza dough to your
        desired thickness and shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Add Sauce and Toppings:</b>
        Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border
        around the edge. Sprinkle half of the mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
        Add your desired toppings. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the
        toppings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bake and Serve:</b>
        Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated pizza stone (or a baking
        sheet). Bake for 12-16 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and
        the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove from the oven, let it cool
        slightly, slice, and serve.
