        skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef or sausage and cook until
        browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Add onion and garlic and cook
        until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce,
        oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for
        at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

        <strong>Combine Cheese Mixture and Cook Noodles:</strong> In a medium
        bowl, combine ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, and pepper.
        Mix well. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions until al
        dente. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble and Bake:</strong> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
        Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking
        dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, overlapping if necessary. Spread half
        of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with half of
        the remaining meat sauce and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers:
        3 noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, remaining meat sauce, and
        remaining mozzarella cheese. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25
        minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until
        the cheese is melted and bubbly and the lasagna is heated through. Let
        stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
