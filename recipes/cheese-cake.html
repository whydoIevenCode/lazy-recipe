      <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ganache:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a
        medium bowl, combine cookie crumbs and melted butter. Press the mixture
        firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes.
        Let cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, beat cream cheese
        and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in cocoa
        powder and vanilla extract. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after
        each addition. Gradually beat in heavy cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the Cheesecake:</strong> Pour the filling over the cooled
        crust. Bake for 55-65 minutes, or until the center is almost set but
        still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven, crack the oven door
        slightly, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour. Then,
        remove from the oven and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours,
        or preferably overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Ganache:</strong> Heat heavy cream in a small
        saucepan over medium heat until simmering. Remove from heat and add
        chopped chocolate. Let stand for 1 minute, then whisk until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble and Serve:</strong> Pour the ganache over the chilled
        cheesecake. Spread evenly. Chill for another 30 minutes to allow the
        ganache to set. Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to release
        the sides. Remove the sides of the springform pan. Slice and serve.
